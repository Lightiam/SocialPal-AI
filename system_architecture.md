## Security Considerations
- Implement OAuth2 with JWT for authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database

## Scalability
- Use asynchronous programming in FastAPI for improved performance
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Design the database schema with indexing for optimized queries
- Consider using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) for handling scheduled posts

## Deployment
- Use containerization (Docker) for easy deployment and scaling
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for load balancing and SSL termination

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable and feature-rich Social Media Manager application, supporting all the required functionalities while adhering to the specified technical stack.
